# Overview

This program implements matrix transformation that processes a large list of coordinates. 

When learning lienar algebra concepts I learned about matrix transformations commonly used on computer graphics. This program was created to test out some of those concepts.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Make it so you can change the transformation matrix to do more than just a 90 degree rotation
* Add in code to do projection and 3d transformations
* Use a graphics library to test this program using real graphics
