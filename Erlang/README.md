# Overview

There are 3 .erl files in this folder. The main software from this project is in "sorting.erl". This file contains a simple insertion sort, as well as two functions to filter out even and odd numbers respectively. The other two files, "test.erl" and "learn.erl", are both documents used to test code ideas and keep sections of code that I did not want to forget, but had no use for in the main project.

This project is my first exploration into the Erlang language and I wrote the included software to expiriment with a variety of Erlang's featrures.

# Future Work

* Fix bugs in the insertion sort so it works with negative numbers.
* Explore other sorting methods. (learn.erl contains a first attempt at a merge sort).
* Experiment with implementing parallelism into the sort using processes.
